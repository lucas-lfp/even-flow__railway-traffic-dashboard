<h1>Overview</h1>
This project aims at creating a dashboard about railway passenger's traffic in Versailles, France (Versailles Chantiers, Versailles Château Rive Gauche, Versailles Rive Droite, Montreuil and Porchefontaine).
Data regarding all five train stations, from 2015 to 2023, were gathered from <a href = "https://data.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/pages/home/" target = "_blank">Île de France Mobilités</a>, <a href = "https://ressources.data.sncf.com/pages/accueil/" target ="_blank">SNCF</a> and <a href = "https://data.ratp.fr/explore/?sort=modified" target = "_blank">RATP</a> open data platforms.

<h1>Dashboard objectives</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Provide a general overview of the traffic, per year and per station</li>
  <li>Assess commute pattern in each station</li>
  <li>Evaluate the impact of Covid-19 outbreak on traffic (2020 to 1st semester of 2023)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Skills used in this project</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Data wrangling and preprocessing was performed using <b>Python</b> in a Jupyter Notebook environment</li>
  <li>Dashboard was created using <b>Power BI Desktop</b></li>
</ul>

<h1>Major findings</h1>
<ul>
  <li>For the past 8 years, Versailles Chantiers stands among Île de France's top most frequented train stations, along with La Défense, Saint-Denis and Juvisy.</li>
  <li>Different commute patterns exist in Versailles: Versailles Rive Droite, Montreuil and Porchefontaine show a strong morning commute while Versailles Chantiers shows an evening commute, suggesting most people arrive by this station to work/study in Versailles. Commute in Versailles Château Rive Gauche is balanced, which was expected as it is the closest station to Versailles' Palace.</li>
  <li>Traffic was halved right after Covid-19 outbreak, then steadily rised up again every year. As of first semester of 2023, every station in Versailles has a traffic equivalent to 2019 (±5%).</li>
  <li>Navigo Pass remain the most common type of pass and is used by 65% of travelers. However, since Covid-19 outbreak, Imagine-R pass users number grows faster.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Other findings of interest</h1>
