# Even Flow - Railway Passenger Traffic Dashboard for Versailles, France

This project aims to analyze and visualize railway passenger traffic data for Versailles, France, focusing on the five train stations: Versailles Chantiers, Versailles Château Rive Gauche, Versailles Rive Droite, Montreuil, and Porchefontaine. Data spanning from 2015 to 2023 were collected from open data platforms such as [Île de France Mobilités](https://data.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/pages/home/), [SNCF](https://ressources.data.sncf.com/pages/accueil/), and [RATP](https://data.ratp.fr/explore/?sort=modified).

## Dashboard Objectives

- Provide a comprehensive overview of passenger traffic, both yearly and per station.
- Analyze commute patterns at each station.
- Evaluate the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on traffic from 2020 to the first semester of 2023.

## Skills Used in This Project

- Data wrangling and preprocessing performed using **Python** in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
- Dashboard creation using **Power BI Desktop**.

## Major Findings

- Versailles Chantiers has consistently been among Île de France's top most frequented train stations over the past 8 years.
- Different commute patterns exist in Versailles, with strong morning commute observed at Versailles Rive Droite, Montreuil, and Porchefontaine, while Versailles Chantiers experiences an evening commute, suggesting most people arrive at this station to work/study in Versailles. Versailles Château Rive Gauche exhibits a balanced commute, as expected due to its proximity to Versailles' Palace.
- Traffic was halved immediately after the Covid-19 outbreak but has been steadily recovering. By the first semester of 2023, every station in Versailles has traffic levels equivalent to 2019 (±5%).
- While Navigo Pass remains the most common type of pass, usage of Imagine-R passes has been growing faster since the Covid-19 outbreak.
